                Fire gave us power. Gossip helped us cooperate. Agriculture made us hungry for more. Mythology maintained law and order. Money gave us something we can really trust. Contradictions created culture. Science made us deadly.

About 13.5 billion years ago, matter, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics.

About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry.

About 70,000 years ago organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. The subsequent development of these human cultures is called history.

Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: The Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something completely different.

Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other.

Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother.

Humans first evolved in East Africa about 2.5 million years ago.

Homo rudolfensis (East Africa); Homo erectus (East Asia); Homo neanderthalensis (Europe and western Asia)

The truth is that from about 2 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago, the world was home, at one and the same time, to several human species.

Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain size of 200 cubic centimetres. The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic centimetres. Modern sapiens sport a brain averaging 1200–1400 cubic centimetres.

We are so enamoured of our high intelligence that we assume that when it comes to cerebral power, more must be better. The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. The brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 percent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 percent of rest-time energy.

It takes a tribe to raise a human. Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming close ties.

A million years ago, Sapiens used early stone tools to crack open bones in order to get marrow, and eating carrion left behind by more powerful carnivores. About 400,000 years ago, several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis. In the last 100,000 years, with the rise of Homo Sapiens — that man jumped to the top of the food chain. They displaced sharks and lions, who had evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years.

By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neaderthals and the forefathers of Homo Sapiens were using fire on a regular basis.

Fire became a source of dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Fire also made possible to cook foods which humans could not digest in their natural forms such as wheat, rice, and potatoes. Fire not only changed it’s chemistry but it’s biology as well. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. When humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force.

About 70,000 years ago, Sapiens from East Africa spread into the Arab peninsula, from where there they quickly overran the entire Eurasian landmass.

It may well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.

Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals. They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate.

Our language evolved as a way of gossiping.

It’s relatively easy to agree that only Homo Sapiens can speak about things that don’t really exist. You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.

Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90% of the calories that feed humanity come from a handful of plans that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC — wheat, rice, maize (corn), potatoes, millet and barley. No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years. If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of ancient farmers.

One of history’s few iron laws is the luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.

A wealthy man in ancient Egypt would have never dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. We are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism.

Bees don’t need lawyer bees, because there is no danger that they might forget or violate the hive constitution.

Between the years 3500 BC and 3000 BC, some Sumerian genuises (in southern Mesopotamia) invented a system for storing and processing information outside their brains, once that was custom-built to handle large amounts of mathematical data (keeping records of stored harvests). This system is called “writing”.

Sumerians had 2 types of signs. One to denote numbers (clay tablets for 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600 and 36000; to divide day into 24 hours and of the circle into 360 degrees) and one to represent people, animals, merchandise, territories, dates and so forth.

Sometime before the 9th century, Arabs invaded India, encountered the numbering system (0 to 9 devised by Hindus), understood its usefulness, refined it, and spread it through the Middle East and then to Europe.

How did humans organize themselves in mass cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.

Hammurabi’s Code, for example, established a pecking order of superiors, commoners, and slaves. Superiors got all the good things in life. Commoners got what was left. Slaves for a beating if they complained.

For instance, many people who have viewed the hierarchy of free persons and slaves as natural and correct have argued that slavery is not a human invention. Hammurabi saw it as ordained by the gods. Aristotle argued that slaves have a ‘slavish nature’ whereas free people have a ‘free nature’. Their status in society is merely a reflection of their innate nature.

Hindus who adhere to the caste system believe that cosmic forces have made one caste superior to another. According to a famous Hindu creation myth, the gods fashioned the world out of the body of a primeval being, the Purusa. The sun was created from Purusa’s brain, the Brahmins (priests) from its mouth, the Kshatriyas (warriors) from its arms, the Vaishyas (peasants and merchants) from its thighs, and the Shudras (servants) from its legs. Accept this explanation and the sociopolitical differences between Brahmins and Shudras are as natural and eternal as the differences between the sun and the moon.
